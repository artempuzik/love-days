        title: 'Manage Conflicts Constructively',
        description: 'Disagreements are a natural aspect of any relationship, but how you handle them can make a difference. Approach conflicts with a problem-solving mindset rather than an adversarial one. Set rules for discussing issues: avoid name-calling, focus on the issue, not the person, and strive to listen actively. Take breaks if emotions run high to prevent saying things you might regret.
